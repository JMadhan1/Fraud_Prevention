⏰ DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE
Day 1: Core backend setup + one working AI model
Day 2: Frontend interface + demo data + second AI model
Day 3: Integration + third AI model + polish + presentation prep
Critical Success Factor: Focus on making ONE feature work perfectly rather than all features working poorly. A brilliant deepfake detector demo beats a mediocre multi-feature app!
This structure gives you everything needed to build a hackathon-winning fraud prevention solution. The key is execution quality and compelling demonstration!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
